Convert CSV files to JSON with ASCII support (to include foreign languages)
==============
# csv2json

Most of the csv2json solutions out there doesn't support foreign languages properly

## Requirements

Make sure your XLS or CSV table has the first row with column names

### Usage

    python csv2json.py [INPUTFILE]

### Alternative usage

You can re-direct to a file to save the json also

    python csv2json.py input_file.csv > output.json
